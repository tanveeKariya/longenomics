    <h1>Privacy Policy for KeepSake</h1>
    <p><em>Last updated: June 26, 2025</em></p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how [KeepSake] ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and discloses your personal information when you use our [KeepSake] application.</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>

    </ul>
    <h3>2.2. Information We Receive from LinkedIn:</h3>
    <p>When you connect your LinkedIn account to our application, you authorize us to access certain information from your LinkedIn profile, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your LinkedIn Member ID</li>
        <li>Your Name</li>
        <li>Your Profile Picture (if available)</li>
        <li>Basic profile information as permitted by LinkedIn's API (e.g., `r_liteprofile` scope).</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>2.3. Automatically Collected Information:</h3>
    <p>We may collect certain information automatically when you use our app, such as your IP address, device type, operating system, and usage data (e.g., features used, time spent).</p>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>**To Provide the Service:** We primarily use your LinkedIn access token and the message content you provide to publish your posts directly to your LinkedIn feed, as authorized by you.</li>
        <li>**Authentication:** To authenticate you with LinkedIn and manage your connection to our service.</li>
        <li>**Service Improvement:** To understand how our application is used and to make improvements.</li>
        <li>**Security:** To maintain the security of our services and prevent misuse.</li>
        <li>**Legal Compliance:** To comply with applicable laws and regulations.</li>

    <h2>4. How We Share Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>**With LinkedIn:** We share the message content and your authorization with LinkedIn's API to facilitate the posting on your behalf. LinkedIn's own privacy policy will govern how they handle the data once it's on their platform.</li>
        <li>**Service Providers:** We may share your information with third-party service providers who perform services on our behalf (e.g., hosting, analytics). These providers are contractually obligated to protect your information.</li>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement reasonable security measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, no internet transmission or electronic storage is completely secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

    </ul>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page with a new "Last updated" date. Your continued use of the application after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
